# University of Helsinki - Full Stack Open - WIP
This course, which is a deep dive into modern web development, introduces modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js, Redux, MongoDB, GraphQL and Typescript. This is the repository where I store my submissions.
